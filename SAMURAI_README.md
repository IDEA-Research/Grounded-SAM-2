## Getting Started

#### SAMURAI Installation 

SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install **the SAMURAI version** of SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:
```
cd sam2
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Please see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/INSTALL.md) from the original SAM 2 repository for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.

Install other requirements:
```
pip install matplotlib==3.7 tikzplotlib jpeg4py opencv-python lmdb pandas scipy loguru
```

#### SAM 2.1 Checkpoint Download

```
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```

#### Data Preparation

Please prepare the data in the following format:
```
data/LaSOT
├── airplane/
│   ├── airplane-1/
│   │   ├── full_occlusion.txt
│   │   ├── groundtruth.txt
│   │   ├── img
│   │   ├── nlp.txt
│   │   └── out_of_view.txt
│   ├── airplane-2/
│   ├── airplane-3/
│   ├── ...
├── basketball
├── bear
├── bicycle
...
├── training_set.txt
└── testing_set.txt
```

#### Main Inference
```
python scripts/main_inference.py 
```

## Demo on Custom Video

To run the demo with your custom video or frame directory, use the following examples:

**Note:** The `.txt` file contains a single line with the bounding box of the first frame in `x,y,w,h` format.

### Input is Video File

```
python scripts/demo.py --video_path <your_video.mp4> --txt_path <path_to_first_frame_bbox.txt>
```

### Input is Frame Folder
```
# Only JPG images are supported
python scripts/demo.py --video_path <your_frame_directory> --txt_path <path_to_first_frame_bbox.txt>
```

## FAQs
**Question 1:** Does SAMURAI need training? [issue 34](https://github.com/yangchris11/samurai/issues/34)

**Answer 1:** Unlike real-life samurai, the proposed samurai do not require additional training. It is a zero-shot method, we directly use the weights from SAM 2.1 to conduct VOT experiments. Kalman filter is used to estimate the current and future state (bounding box location and scale in our case) of a moving object based on measurements over time, it is a common approach that had been adapt in the field of tracking for a long time which does not requires any training. Please refer to code for more detail.

**Question 2:** Does SAMURAI support streaming input (e.g. webcam)?

**Answer 2:** Not yet. The existing code doesn't support live/streaming video as we inherit most of the codebase from the amazing SAM 2. Some discussion that you might be interested in: facebookresearch/sam2#90, facebookresearch/sam2#388 (comment).

**Question 3:** How to use SAMURAI in longer video?

**Answer 3:** See the discussion from sam2 https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/issues/264.


## Acknowledgment

SAMURAI is built on top of [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Meta FAIR.

The VOT evaluation code is modifed from [VOT Toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit) by Luka Čehovin Zajc.
