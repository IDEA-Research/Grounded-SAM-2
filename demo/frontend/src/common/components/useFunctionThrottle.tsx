   * The following function's callback gets throttled when the time between two
   * executions is less than a threshold.
   *
   * The threshold is calculated linearly by multiplying the initial delay
   * and the number of times the button has been throttled. The button can be
   * throttled up to numThrottles times.
   *
   * The function has an optional flag - enableThrottling - which allows a callsite
   * to optionally disable throttling. This is useful in cases where throttling may
   * not be necessary. (e.g. for the Track & Play buttonï£¿, we would only like to
   * throttle after a stream is aborted.)
