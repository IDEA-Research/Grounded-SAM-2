# Grounded SAM 2
Grounded SAM 2: Ground and Track Anything in Videos with [Grounding DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499), [Grounding DINO 1.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10300), [Florence-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242) and [SAM 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00714).

**ðŸ”¥ Project Highlight**

In this repo, we've supported the following demo with **simple implementations**:
- **Ground and Segment Anything** with Grounding DINO, Grounding DINO 1.5 & 1.6 and SAM 2
- **Ground and Track Anything** with Grounding DINO, Grounding DINO 1.5 & 1.6 and SAM 2
- **Detect, Segment and Track Visualization** based on the powerful [supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision) library.

Grounded SAM 2 does not introduce significant methodological changes compared to [Grounded SAM: Assembling Open-World Models for Diverse Visual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14159). Both approaches leverage the capabilities of open-world models to address complex visual tasks. Consequently, we try to **simplify the code implementation** in this repository, aiming to enhance user convenience.

## Installation

Download the pretrained `SAM 2` checkpoints:

```bash
cd checkpoints
bash download_ckpts.sh
```

Download the pretrained `Grounding DINO` checkpoints:

```bash
cd gdino_checkpoints
bash download_ckpts.sh
```

### Installation without docker

Install PyTorch environment first. We use `python=3.10`, as well as `torch >= 2.3.1`, `torchvision>=0.18.1` and `cuda-12.1` in our environment to run this demo. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended. You can easily install the latest version of PyTorch as follows:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

Since we need the CUDA compilation environment to compile the `Deformable Attention` operator used in Grounding DINO, we need to check whether the CUDA environment variables have been set correctly (which you can refer to [Grounding DINO Installation](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO?tab=readme-ov-file#hammer_and_wrench-install) for more details). You can set the environment variable manually as follows if you want to build a local GPU environment for Grounding DINO to run Grounded SAM 2:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/cuda-12.1/
```

Install `Segment Anything 2`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install `Grounding DINO`:

```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation -e grounding_dino
```

### Installation with docker
Build the Docker image and Run the Docker container:

```
cd Grounded-SAM-2
make build-image
make run
```
After executing these commands, you will be inside the Docker environment. The working directory within the container is set to: `/home/appuser/Grounded-SAM-2`

Once inside the Docker environment, you can start the demo by running:
```
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo.py
```

## Grounded SAM 2 Demos
### Grounded SAM 2 Image Demo (with Grounding DINO)
Note that `Grounding DINO` has already been supported in [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny), so we provide two choices for running `Grounded SAM 2` model:
- Use huggingface API to inference Grounding DINO (which is simple and clear)

```bash
python grounded_sam2_hf_model_demo.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸš¨ If you encounter network issues while using the `HuggingFace` model, you can resolve them by setting the appropriate mirror source as `export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`

- Load local pretrained Grounding DINO checkpoint and inference with Grounding DINO original API (make sure you've already downloaded the pretrained checkpoint)

```bash
python grounded_sam2_local_demo.py
```


### Grounded SAM 2 Image Demo (with Grounding DINO 1.5 & 1.6)

We've already released our most capable open-set detection model [Grounding DINO 1.5 & 1.6](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounding-DINO-1.5-API), which can be combined with SAM 2 for stronger open-set detection and segmentation capability. You can apply the API token first and run Grounded SAM 2 with Grounding DINO 1.5 as follows:

Install the latest DDS cloudapi:

```bash
pip install dds-cloudapi-sdk
```

Apply your API token from our official website here: [request API token](https://deepdataspace.com/request_api).

```bash
python grounded_sam2_gd1.5_demo.py
```

### Automatically Saving Grounding Results (Image Demo)

After setting `DUMP_JSON_RESULTS=True` in the following Grounded SAM 2 Image Demos:
- [grounded_sam2_local_demo.py](./grounded_sam2_local_demo.py)
- [grounded_sam2_hf_model_demo.py](./grounded_sam2_hf_model_demo.py)
- [grounded_sam2_gd1.5_demo.py](./grounded_sam2_gd1.5_demo.py)

The `grounding` and `segmentation` results will be automatically saved in the `outputs` dir with the following format:

```python
{
    "image_path": "path/to/image.jpg",
    "annotations": [
        {
            "class_name": "class_name",
            "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
            "segmentation": {
                "size": [h, w],
                "counts": "rle_encoded_mask"
            },
            "score": confidence score
        }
    ],
    "box_format": "xyxy",
    "img_width": w,
    "img_height": h
}
```



### Grounded SAM 2 Video Object Tracking Demo

Based on the strong tracking capability of SAM 2, we can combined it with Grounding DINO for open-set object segmentation and tracking. You can run the following scripts to get the tracking results with Grounded SAM 2:

```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo.py
```

- The tracking results of each frame will be saved in `./tracking_results`
- The video will be save as `children_tracking_demo_video.mp4`
- You can refine this file with different text prompt and video clips yourself to get more tracking results.
- We only prompt the first video frame with Grounding DINO here for simple usage.

#### Support Various Prompt Type for Tracking

We've supported different types of prompt for Grounded SAM 2 tracking demo:

- **Point Prompt**: In order to **get a stable segmentation results**, we re-use the SAM 2 image predictor to get the prediction mask from each object based on Grounding DINO box outputs, then we **uniformly sample points from the prediction mask** as point prompts for SAM 2 video predictor
- **Box Prompt**: We directly use the box outputs from Grounding DINO as box prompts for SAM 2 video predictor
- **Mask Prompt**: We use the SAM 2 mask prediction results based on Grounding DINO box outputs as mask prompt for SAM 2 video predictor.

### Grounded SAM 2 Video Object Tracking Demo (with Grounding DINO 1.5 & 1.6)

We've also support video object tracking demo based on our stronger `Grounding DINO 1.5` model and `SAM 2`, you can try the following demo after applying the API keys for running `Grounding DINO 1.5`:

```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_with_gd1.5.py
```

### Grounded SAM 2 Video Object Tracking Demo with Custom Video Input (with Grounding DINO)

Users can upload their own video file (e.g. `assets/hippopotamus.mp4`) and specify their custom text prompts for grounding and tracking with Grounding DINO and SAM 2 by using the following scripts:

```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_custom_video_input_gd1.0_hf_model.py
```

If you are not convenient to use huggingface demo, you can also run tracking demo with local grounding dino model with the following scripts:

```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_custom_video_input_gd1.0_local_model.py
```

### Grounded SAM 2 Video Object Tracking Demo with Custom Video Input (with Grounding DINO 1.5 & 1.6)

Users can upload their own video file (e.g. `assets/hippopotamus.mp4`) and specify their custom text prompts for grounding and tracking with Grounding DINO 1.5 and SAM 2 by using the following scripts:

```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_custom_video_input_gd1.5.py
```

You can specify the params in this file:

```python
VIDEO_PATH = "./assets/hippopotamus.mp4"
TEXT_PROMPT = "hippopotamus."
OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH = "./hippopotamus_tracking_demo.mp4"
API_TOKEN_FOR_GD1_5 = "Your API token" # api token for G-DINO 1.5
PROMPT_TYPE_FOR_VIDEO = "mask" # using SAM 2 mask prediction as prompt for video predictor
```

After running our demo code, you can get the tracking results as follows:

[![Video Name](./assets/hippopotamus_seg.jpg)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fbdc6f4-3e50-4221-9600-98c397beecdf)

And we will automatically save the tracking visualization results in `OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH`.

> [!WARNING]
> We initialize the box prompts on the first frame of the input video. If you want to start from different frame, you can refine `ann_frame_idx` by yourself in our code.

### Grounded-SAM-2 Video Object Tracking with Continuous ID (with Grounding DINO)

In above demos, we only prompt Grounded SAM 2 in specific frame, which may not be friendly to find new object during the whole video. In this demo, we try to **find new objects** and assign them with new ID across the whole video, this function is **still under develop**. it's not that stable now.

Users can upload their own video files and specify custom text prompts for grounding and tracking using the Grounding DINO and SAM 2 frameworks. To do this, execute the script:


```bash 
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_with_continuous_id.py
```

You can customize various parameters including:

- `text`: The grounding text prompt.
- `video_dir`: Directory containing the video files.
- `output_dir`: Directory to save the processed output.
- `output_video_path`: Path for the output video.
- `step`: Frame stepping for processing.
- `box_threshold`: box threshold for groundingdino model
- `text_threshold`: text threshold for groundingdino model
Note: This method supports only the mask type of text prompt.

After running our demo code, you can get the tracking results as follows:

[![Video Name](./assets/tracking_car_mask_1.jpg)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f91ad0-3d32-43c4-a0dc-0bed661415f4)

If you want to try `Grounding DINO 1.5` model, you can run the following scripts after setting your API token:

```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_with_continuous_id_gd1.5.py
```

### Grounded-SAM-2 Video Object Tracking with Continuous ID plus Reverse Tracking(with Grounding DINO)
This method could simply cover the whole lifetime of the object
```bash
python grounded_sam2_tracking_demo_with_continuous_id_plus.py

```

## Grounded SAM 2 Florence-2 Demos
### Grounded SAM 2 Florence-2 Image Demo

In this section, we will explore how to integrate the feature-rich and robust open-source models [Florence-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242) and SAM 2 to develop practical applications.

[Florence-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06242) is a powerful vision foundation model by Microsoft which supports a series of vision tasks by prompting with special `task_prompt` includes but not limited to:

| Task | Task Prompt | Text Input | Task Introduction |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Object Detection | `<OD>` | &#10008; | Detect main objects with single category name |
| Dense Region Caption | `<DENSE_REGION_CAPTION>` | &#10008; | Detect main objects with short description |
| Region Proposal | `<REGION_PROPOSAL>` | &#10008; | Generate proposals without category name |
| Phrase Grounding | `<CAPTION_TO_PHRASE_GROUNDING>` | &#10004; | Ground main objects in image mentioned in caption |
| Referring Expression Segmentation | `<REFERRING_EXPRESSION_SEGMENTATION>` | &#10004; | Ground the object which is most related to the text input |
| Open Vocabulary Detection and Segmentation | `<OPEN_VOCABULARY_DETECTION>` | &#10004; | Ground any object with text input |


Integrate `Florence-2` with `SAM-2`, we can build a strong vision pipeline to solve complex vision tasks, you can try the following scripts to run the demo:

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸš¨ If you encounter network issues while using the `HuggingFace` model, you can resolve them by setting the appropriate mirror source as `export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`

**Object Detection and Segmentation**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_image_demo.py \
    --pipeline object_detection_segmentation \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/cars.jpg
```

**Dense Region Caption and Segmentation**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_image_demo.py \
    --pipeline dense_region_caption_segmentation \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/cars.jpg
```

**Region Proposal and Segmentation**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_image_demo.py \
    --pipeline region_proposal_segmentation \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/cars.jpg
```

**Phrase Grounding and Segmentation**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_image_demo.py \
    --pipeline phrase_grounding_segmentation \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/cars.jpg \
    --text_input "The image shows two vintage Chevrolet cars parked side by side, with one being a red convertible and the other a pink sedan, \
            set against the backdrop of an urban area with a multi-story building and trees. \
            The cars have Cuban license plates, indicating a location likely in Cuba."
```

**Referring Expression Segmentation**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_image_demo.py \
    --pipeline referring_expression_segmentation \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/cars.jpg \
    --text_input "The left red car."
```

**Open-Vocabulary Detection and Segmentation**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_image_demo.py \
    --pipeline open_vocabulary_detection_segmentation \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/cars.jpg \
    --text_input "car <and> building"
```
- Note that if you want to detect multi-objects you should split them with `<and>` in your input text.


### Grounded SAM 2 Florence-2 Image Auto-Labeling Demo
`Florence-2` can be used as a auto image annotator by cascading its caption capability with its grounding capability. 

| Task | Task Prompt | Text Input |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Caption + Phrase Grounding | `<CAPTION>` + `<CAPTION_TO_PHRASE_GROUNDING>` | &#10008; |
| Detailed Caption + Phrase Grounding | `<DETAILED_CAPTION>` + `<CAPTION_TO_PHRASE_GROUNDING>` | &#10008; |
| More Detailed Caption + Phrase Grounding | `<MORE_DETAILED_CAPTION>` + `<CAPTION_TO_PHRASE_GROUNDING>` | &#10008; |

You can try the following scripts to run these demo:

**Caption to Phrase Grounding**
```bash
python grounded_sam2_florence2_autolabel_pipeline.py \
    --image_path ./notebooks/images/groceries.jpg \
    --pipeline caption_to_phrase_grounding \
    --caption_type caption
```

- You can specify `caption_type` to control the granularity of the caption, if you want a more detailed caption, you can try `--caption_type detailed_caption` or `--caption_type more_detailed_caption`.
